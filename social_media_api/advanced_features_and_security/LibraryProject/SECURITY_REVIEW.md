# Security Review for LibraryProject

## Overview
This review summarizes the HTTPS and secure header measures implemented for LibraryProject, following Django and web security best practices.

## HTTPS Enforcement
- **SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True**: All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
- **SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000**: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled for 1 year, instructing browsers to only use HTTPS.
- **SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True**: HSTS policy applies to all subdomains.
- **SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True**: Site is eligible for browser HSTS preload lists.

## Secure Cookies
- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True**: Session cookies only sent over HTTPS.
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True**: CSRF cookies only sent over HTTPS.

## Secure Headers
- **X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'**: Prevents clickjacking by denying framing.
- **SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the content type.
- **SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True**: Enables browser XSS filtering.
- **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: Configured via django-csp to restrict script/style/image sources to self.

## Deployment
- Example Nginx and Apache SSL configurations provided in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Strongly recommended to use Let's Encrypt or another CA for SSL certificates.

## Areas for Improvement
- Move all secrets and sensitive settings to environment variables.
- Consider automated vulnerability scanning and regular dependency updates.
- Monitor web server and application logs for suspicious activity.
